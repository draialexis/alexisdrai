    <p><strong>02:00 AM (so, 02/11/2020 technically) --</strong> I smoked my last cigarette less than an hour ago. I
      threw the unfinished pack in the trash and started setting up this log. If you're reading this, I'm probably fine,
      and I'm thankful that you're taking the time. My approach was to consult a general practitioner after doing some
      research on effective cessation methods. I was recommended the usual nicotine substitute method, and therefore
      I'll be using patches all November. If the going gets tough, I also have special lozenges that are supposed to
      help.</p>
    <p>I'm not planning on using those -- place your bets! In the first few months, you can expect short daily updates
      here, linked and announced on <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/rybByt_">Twitter</a>. Wish me luck!</p>
    <p><em>P.S.: You'll find trackers, each day, for</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>how many days I've spent without tobacco</em>
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>how many days I've spent without nicotine</em>: (the patches are 14mg nicotine over 24 hours. I'll probably
        be
        cutting
        them in two, because I was at around 10mg before quitting, and I'd rather dive down to 7mg than increase my
        intake, even if for only a month.The lozenges are 1.5mg each.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>how much money I've saved by quitting</em>: (basically, my medical and pharmaceutical expenses related to
        nicotine cessation will be compared to my past average daily expenses linked to smoking. For reference, med
        expenses were 20.14â‚¬ at start, and cig expenses were slightly above 2.19â‚¬ daily.That's as simple as I want to
        make it for now, and it seems like a good motivator.)

    <p><strong>00:30 AM (so, 03/11/2020 technically) --</strong> Well, fuck, me! I'm using a patch so it could probably
      have been worse, but this is harder than I thought. I'm restless, time seems to pass slowly, and I'm warm and
      sweaty and distracted. But I made it so far. Now let's see if I can sleep.</p>
    <p><strong>In retrospect</strong>, and as I mentioned above, it's also easier than it could have been in some ways.
      One other reason is the support I'm getting from knowing that some people care and are paying attention to my
      resolution and my progress: some family members, some perfect strangers, some friends. They know, I know that they
      know -- there's no going back without disappointing basically everybody. And that's all for the better.</p>
    <p>Also, I totally used my first nicotine lozenge on night #1 like some sort of chump.</p>

    <h3 class="text-uppercase">Day 2 - nov. 3, 2020</h3>
    <p><strong>10:30 PM --</strong> I started today with the satisfaction of knowing I can get through a day and night.
      Still restless, but pretty effective at brute forcing through stuff. I cleaned my whole place up and rearranged
      it. May well wash the walls tomorrow.</p>
    <p>If it goes exceptionally well, I may study instead (or on top) of cleaning. But I fear sitting at my desk
      listening to content, be it academic or otherwise, will bring my smoking habits back to my mind.</p>
    <p>At this point, I don't think I'll smoke again, but I do think quitting could burn me out or bring me down if I
      don't manage the process intelligently.</p>

    <p><strong>11:30 AM --</strong> Feeling tired! Quitting had a noticeable effect on my sleeping, and so did the US
      election... I'm gonna need something sweet and unreasonable to munch on today. On the plus side, I was able to pay
      attention to a three hours long lecture this morning, so... yay.</p>
    <p><strong>[X Hours Later...] --</strong> I came here to eat sweets and watch a Dem take Pennsylvania. And I'm all
      out
      of sweets!</p>
    <p>I -- I ate them all...</p>
    <p><strong>11:00 PM --</strong> I forgot... I forgot, and I had that stupid automatic thought: "I know, I'll just
      have a cigarette while waiting for X." I realised what was happening almost instantly, but it was a bit scary to
      feel that... Still going strong though.</p>

    <p><strong>02:45 PM --</strong> Washing the walls to channel that energy. That should be my workout for the rest of
      the week! I remember how my hands would smell, the times I would smoke after handling those cleaning products --
      and I much prefer this current version of me.</p>
    <p><strong>11:00 PM --</strong> I cut today's patch in half and it was fine. Getting closer to freedom already. It
      seems, after botching cookies yesterday and a pizza tonight, that my cooking flair came from my smoking all along!
      Or it's, you know, any other explanation...</p>

    <p><strong>05:15 PM --</strong> I'm kinda done deep-cleaning for this year. Apart from that, today was quite
      exciting: (safe) cake date, Georgia and Pennsylvania reveal, and it was exceptionally sunny and mild where I'm at.
      Cravings came and went, but I'm feeling all right about life.</p>

    <h3 class="text-uppercase">Day 6 - nov. 7, 2020</h3>
    <p><strong>04:30 PM --</strong> So, today was pretty fucking weird. To be fair, this whole year's been unpredictable
      and disorienting for most humans, this autumn especially.</p>
    <p>I spent a few hours crying in my bed today. I've also thought about why that happened. And I mean, sure, many
      citizens have been showing complacency when faced with fascism and authoritarianism at home and abroad.
      Governments have been displaying too little willingness to preserve an inhabitable world for our species. Old,
      bad, dead ideas, like market protectionism and eugenics, have been resurfacing.</p>
    <p>And maybe it looks like I'm straying out of scope for this smoking cessation log, but I don't
      think so. The thing is, I used to have a number of outlets for this 21st century funk many of us are feeling right
      now. Some of those outlets are gone: I'm away from those I care about, I'm stuck inside, and I won't smoke
      anymore. I hadn't cried in a very long time, and right now I feel that it might be because I used to have those
      other outlets. My will has been wavering, and yeah, I've thought about how I could maybe forget about quitting for
      now, and even hide or lie to y'all about it (!), but I'm still in the game and I'm happy to report: it'll take
      a bit more that the above list of grievances to make me take that fucking step back.</p>

    <p><strong>11:30 PM --</strong> Kind of a 'meh' day honestly. Didn't find the motivation to study for tomorrow's
      exam. I'm planning to work extra hard later, when I'm not fiending anymore, if it turns out I did need to work.
      Procrastinating -- I'm procrastinating, with exams tomorrow.</p>
    <p class="flex-center milestone">Err, "kind of a 'meh' day"... for a milestone! The more observant among you will,
      no doubt, have noticed that I quit smoking one week ago ðŸ¤—</p>

    <h3 class="text-uppercase">Day 8 - nov. 9, 2020</h3>
    <p><strong>06:30 PM --</strong> It's been hard to focus for about eight days (weird, right?). And it was more
      important today. I've had a hard time getting to study, or sticking to it more than a few minutes, and it
      showed during my exam performance today.</p>
    <p>Now, I don't want to dramatise. I didn't do <em>that</em> bad, I don't think. Also, I will hopefully be in better
      shape by the time the finals roll up, in January, which should help my average grades.</p>
    <p>Addiction-wise, I've been thinking about smoking -- as in, the physical act. Picturing it, remembering the
      sensations. I don't want it. There's a lot I really don't miss about it. In a way, it's something that became a
      habit and a need for me <em>after</em> I got used to the smell, to the physical reactions, and all that. There was
      a barrier to entry, in that way, and that barrier has come back at some point this month. All that being said, I
      don't miss smoking <em>per se</em>, but I do miss something as a result of quitting. Part of the challenge is
      going to be to form new habits that are better, or neutral. Food for my addled thoughts...</p>
    <p>Hey wait a minute, here's an idea: Food! </p>

    <p><strong>08:45 PM --</strong> Today's exam went much better. Also I ate too much, took a nap, and just generally
      indulged myself more than might be advisable. I don't wanna "get soft" but I don't wanna crash and burn out; guess
      I'll keep thinking about that balance, at least as long as I keep writing here.</p>
    <p class="flex-center milestone">Kind of an interesting milestone today: my tobacco savings have overtaken my pharma
      expenses ðŸ¤— turns out I'll be saving about 69â‚¬/month from now on, if there are no further pharma expenses.</p>
    <p><strong>11:00 AM (night update) --</strong> I know we're not close like that, but I had a (patch-induced?) dream
      that belongs in a log, so:</p>
    <p>I fought a smart dog with a sci-fi flamethrower. It was <em>me</em> who was using the flamethrower, by the way --
      the dog wasn't that smart. Although it <em>did</em> win... I had to escape through a university, that looked like
      my hometown's police station (which is a pretty cool building actually, like: 17th century royal stables with
      arches, high ceilings, internal courtyards and stuff). Some civilians didn't make it...

    <p><strong>04:30 PM --</strong> Study and self-care today! It's been a good day so far, except for the mild headache
      that's been in the background for a while. But no matter: white noise helps me focus, and I've been studying shell
      bash all afternoon and making headway.</p>
    <p>Discovered a Japanese delicatessen near my place and had a great bento for lunch. Planning on spending some time
      on the phone with good friends and family, then get some components started for tomorrow's dinner. Couple push-ups
      here and there, and we've got ourselves a pretty exemplary day.</p>

      Some cravings so far, but I react to those with either a drink of water or a dozen push-ups. I'm also trying to
      notice how my hands smell like soap and paper, and be mindful of those details.</p>

      brief moments. Resting was actually what brought the thought to my head, I think... but maybe letting the mind
      wander isn't so bad, regardless.</p>

      I'll sound out everyday still, but I won't make a long form post if there's nothing new to say. What I mean is,
      this may be a turning point where I don't feel like I need to monologue about this whole endeavour everyday. Get
      in touch if this makes you sad, although I suspect we're already in touch if you're reading this.</p>
