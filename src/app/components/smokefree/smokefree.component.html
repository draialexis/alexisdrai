    <p><strong>02:00 AM (so, 02/11/2020 technically) --</strong> I smoked my last cigarette less than an hour ago. I
      threw the
      unfinished pack in the trash and started setting up this log. If you're reading this, I'm probably fine, and I'm
      thankful that you're taking the time. My approach was to consult a general practitioner after doing some research
      on effective cessation methods. I was recommended the usual nicotine substitute method, and therefore I'll be
      using patches all November. If the going gets tough, I also have special lozenges that are supposed to help. I'm
      not planning on using those -- place your bets! In the first few months, you can expect short daily updates here,
      linked and announced on <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/rybByt_">Twitter</a>. Wish me luck!</p>

    <p><strong>00:30 AM --</strong> Well, fuck me. I'm using a patch so it could probably have been worse, but this is
      harder than I thought. I'm restless, time seems to pass slowly, and I'm warm and sweaty and distracted. But I made
      it so far. Now let's see if I can sleep.</p>
    <p><strong>In retrospect</strong>, and as I mentioned above, it's also easier than it could have been in some ways.
      One other reason
      is the support I'm getting from knowing that some people care and are paying attention to my resolution and my
      progress: some family members, some perfect strangers, some friends, and even the woman I have a crush
      on. They know, I know that they know -- there's no going back without disappointing basically everybody. And
      that's all for the better. Also, I totally used my first nicotine lozenge on night #1 like some sort of chump.</p>

    <h3 class="text-uppercase">Day 2 - nov. 3, 2020</h3>
    <p><strong>10:30 PM --</strong> I started today with the satisfaction of knowing I can get through a day and night.
      Still restless, but pretty effective at brute forcing through stuff. I cleaned my whole place up and rearranged
      it. May well wash the walls tomorrow.</p>
    <p>If it goes exceptionally well, I may study instead (or on top) of cleaning. But I fear sitting at my desk
      listening to content, be it academic or otherwise, will bring my smoking habits back to my mind.</p>
    <p>At this point, I don't think I'll smoke again, but I do think quitting could burn me out or bring me down if I
      don't manage the process intelligently.</p>

    <p><strong>11:30 AM --</strong> Feeling tired! Quitting had a noticeable effect on my sleeping, and so did the US
      election... I'm gonna need something sweet and unreasonable to munch on today. On the plus side, I was able to pay
      attention to a three hours long lecture this morning, so... yay.</p>
    <p><strong>[X Hours Later...]</strong> I came here to eat sweets and watch a Dem take Pennsylvania. And I'm all out
      of sweets! I -- I ate them all...</p>
    <p><strong>11:00 PM --</strong> I forgot... I forgot, and I had that stupid automatic thought: "I know, I'll just
      have a cigarette while waiting for X." I realised what was happening almost instantly, but it was a bit scary to
      feel that... Still going strong though.</p>

    <p><strong>02:45 PM --</strong> Washing the walls to channel that energy. That should be my workout for the rest of
      the week! I remember how my hands would smell, the times I would smoke after handling those cleaning products --
      and I much prefer this version of me.</p>
    <p><strong>11:00 PM --</strong> I cut today's patch in half and it was fine. Getting closer to freedom already. It
      seems, after botching cookies
      yesterday and a pizza tonight, that my cooking flair came from my smoking all along! Or it's, you know, any other
      explanation...</p>

    <p><strong>05:15 PM --</strong> I'm kinda done deep-cleaning for this year. Apart from that, today was quite exciting: cake
      date, Georgia and Pennsylvania reveal, and it was exceptionally sunny and mild where I'm at. Cravings came and
      went, but I'm feeling all right about life.</p>
